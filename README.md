# Formula 1 Website Redesign

The official Formula 1 website has been redesigned with the goal of enhancing the user experience by simplifying navigation, modernizing the visual design, and minimizing clutter. 

# Features:

1) A responsive design that allows for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
2) Streamlined navigation that provides easier access to information.
3) Up-to-date information on the latest races, drivers, teams, and standings, all pulled from a SQL database.
4) An interactive race schedule that includes details on time, location, and track information.
5) Individualized profile pages that allow users to select their favorite driver, team, and track.

# Challenges/Bugs:

In addition to the features listed above, there were some challenges encountered during the redesign process. 

1) Weather API Integration: One of the challenges faced was integrating a weather API to display the weather of the race location during race week due to only having a certain amount of fetch calls to the API. 

2) Compatibility Issues: Another challenge was compatibility issues with iPhone landscape view, which caused some layout problems, mostly because I dont know the aspect ratio that IPhone's landscape is.

3) Admin Website Edits: The admin website is an essential part of managing the content of the Formula 1 website. However, the design and layout of the admin website needed improvement to ensure that the admin website is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
